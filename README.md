## How to perform the exercise?
Click on the Launch Binder button, then a Binder window will open. A docker container with all necessary images will be created automatically. After a successful creation, a Jupyter window will be opened. Open Logistische_Regression_Projekt.ipynb and then click on Run All at the top of Cell.

## Expected results ?
In this project we will work with fake data on advertisements, which will show whether a user clicked on an advertisement on a company's website or not. We will try to create a model that predicts whether or not a user will click on the ads based on user characteristics.

1. Read data
2. Explorative data analysis of data
3. Generate some visualizations for a general overview
4. Train and fit a logistic regression model to the training set
5. Predictions and evaluation
